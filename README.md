YouTube Video and MP3 Downloader for Windows, only.
----------------------------------
We need a pafy library to download a videos from YouTube.
We need an os library to check if the file is already installed and execute the youtube-dl command and clear The Terminal.
We need a time library to sleep one second when we finish.
We need a termcolor library to make our Tool more beautiful.
----------------------------------
If you don't have any of these libraries go to Google and type: How to install [The_Library] library in Python.
If you don't have a youtube-dl in your CMD, you can go to Google and type: How to install youtube-dl in Windows CMD.
